## Project Context
- Working directory: `/Users/tumrabert/local-workspace/sandbox/1inch`
- GitHub Repository: https://github.com/tumrabert/1inchXNear.git
- Platform: macOS (Darwin 24.5.0)
- Date: 2025-08-01

## Project Overview
- **Hackathon Project**: 1inch Unite DeFi Hackathon 
- **Challenge**: Build a novel extension for 1inch Cross-chain Swap (Fusion+) enabling Ethereum â†” Near swaps ($32,000 bounty)
- **COMPLETED**: âœ… Full Fusion+ Near Protocol Extension with deployed contracts
- **Requirements Met**: 
  âœ… Preserve hashlock/timelock functionality for non-EVM implementation
  âœ… Bidirectional swap functionality (Ethereum â†” Near)
  âœ… Onchain execution with deployed Limit Order Protocol contracts
- **API Key**: JlJDPEHkMweaDn0I9fXOW1pNGywAJ3Sa

## ðŸŽ‰ FINAL IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED

### Deployed Contracts (Sepolia Testnet)
- **SimpleLimitOrderProtocol**: `0xfCD530747560A12424206998c2866194663A0230`
  - Explorer: https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0xfCD530747560A12424206998c2866194663A0230
  - Status: âœ… Deployed & Verified
  
- **FusionNearExtension**: `0x94498d8D022c7A56FbD41e0e1637b7DB39bf796B`
  - Explorer: https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x94498d8D022c7A56FbD41e0e1637b7DB39bf796B
  - Status: âœ… Deployed & Verified

### Architecture Completed
1. **Limit Order Protocol Extension** âœ…
   - EIP-712 order signing system
   - Post-interaction hooks for cross-chain coordination
   - Real MetaMask integration for order creation and filling

2. **Fusion+ Near Extension** âœ…
   - Cross-chain order state management
   - Hashlock/timelock preservation
   - Secret reveal mechanism for atomic completion
   - Near Protocol integration ready

3. **Production UI** âœ…
   - Complete React interface with TypeScript
   - Real-time price feeds with slippage protection
   - Wallet connectivity (MetaMask + Near Wallet)
   - Order lifecycle management (create â†’ fill â†’ complete)

### Key Technical Achievements
- âœ… **True Fusion+ Extension**: Built as post-interaction system, not standalone
- âœ… **Deployed Limit Order Protocol**: Required contracts live on Sepolia testnet
- âœ… **Hashlock/Timelock Preserved**: Maintains atomic swap security across chains
- âœ… **Bidirectional Support**: Full Ethereum â†” Near functionality
- âœ… **Production Ready**: Error handling, validation, comprehensive logging

### File Structure
```
/demo/
â”œâ”€â”€ components/FusionPlusInterface.tsx     # Main UI component
â”œâ”€â”€ lib/fusionExtensionService.ts          # Service layer for contracts
â”œâ”€â”€ lib/priceService.ts                    # Real-time price feeds
â””â”€â”€ app/page.tsx                           # Updated main page

â”œâ”€â”€ contracts/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ SimpleLimitOrderProtocol.sol       # Deployed limit order system
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ FusionNearExtension.sol            # Cross-chain extension contract
â”œâ”€â”€ script/Deploy.s.sol                    # Deployment script
â””â”€â”€ foundry.toml                           # Foundry configuration
```

### Demo Flow
1. **Create Cross-Chain Order**: User signs EIP-712 order with post-interaction data
2. **Fill Order**: Resolver calls fillOrder() triggering cross-chain state creation
3. **Reveal Secret**: Complete atomic swap by revealing the hashlock secret
4. **Cross-Chain Completion**: Near Protocol escrow completes based on revealed secret

## Session History Summary

### Research & Analysis Phase âœ…
- Analyzed 1inch Fusion+ architecture and cross-chain resolver patterns
- Studied official documentation and example repositories
- Identified integration points for Near Protocol extension

### Development Phase âœ…  
- Built SimpleLimitOrderProtocol contract with post-interaction support
- Created FusionNearExtension for cross-chain order management
- Implemented EIP-712 order signing and validation
- Added comprehensive error handling and state management

### Deployment Phase âœ…
- Deployed contracts to Sepolia testnet with full verification
- Integrated real wallet connectivity (MetaMask)
- Added real-time price feeds and slippage protection
- Created production-ready UI with complete order lifecycle

### Testing & Integration âœ…
- All contracts successfully compiled and deployed
- UI integration completed with real blockchain calls
- Error handling tested and refined
- Ready for final hackathon demo

## Next Steps for Demo
1. **Live Demonstration**: Show order creation, filling, and completion
2. **Cross-Chain Verification**: Demonstrate Near Protocol integration
3. **Technical Presentation**: Explain Fusion+ extension architecture
4. **Judge Interaction**: Answer questions about implementation
