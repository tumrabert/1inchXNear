## Research Findings Summary

### 1inch Fusion+ Architecture
- **Cross-chain atomic swaps** using EscrowSrc, EscrowDst, EscrowFactory contracts

- **Timelock system**: 7-stage progression with private/public phases
- **Safety deposits**: Native token incentives for completion
- **Integration**: Built on Limit Order Protocol with post-interactions

### Near Protocol Development
- **Smart contracts**: Written in Rust, compiled to WebAssembly (WASM)
- **Development tools**: NEAR SDK, NEAR CLI-RS, Foundry-like tooling

- **Development Resources**: cargo-near, wallet selector, near-api-js documentation

## Smart Contract Architecture Design

### Core Components Overview
Based on 1inch Fusion+ analysis and NEAR examples, adapting components for Ethereum ↔ Near:

#### Ethereum Side (Solidity)
1. **EscrowSrc**: Holds user tokens on Ethereum (adapted from 1inch)
2. **EscrowFactory**: Deploys escrow contracts via CREATE2
3. **Integration**: Post-interaction hooks with 1inch Limit Order Protocol

#### Near Side (Rust/WASM)  
1. **EscrowDst**: Holds resolver tokens on Near Protocol
2. **EscrowFactory**: Near equivalent using contract deployment patterns
3. **FT Integration**: Support for NEAR fungible tokens (NEP-141)
4. **Chain Signatures**: Leverage NEAR's chain abstraction for Ethereum interaction

#### Key Adaptations Required
- **Hashlock**: Preserve keccak256(secret) compatibility across chains
- **Timelock**: Adapt 7-stage system to Near's block height timing
- **Partial Fills**: Implement Merkle tree validation in Rust
- **Safety Deposits**: Use native NEAR tokens with proper economics
- **TEE Integration**: Optional trusted execution environment for advanced solver patterns
