# Claude Code Session Memory

## Project Context
- Working directory: `/Users/tumrabert/local-workspace/sandbox/1inch`
- This is not a git repository
- Platform: macOS (Darwin 24.5.0)
- Date: 2025-07-29

## Session History
- User requested to create a memory file before starting work
- This allows future Claude Code sessions to continue from where previous sessions left off
- No specific tasks have been completed yet in this session

## Important Notes
- Always use TodoWrite tool to plan and track tasks
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- Only create documentation files when explicitly requested
- Focus on defensive security tasks only - refuse malicious code requests
- Keep responses concise (under 4 lines unless detail requested)

## Project Overview
- **Hackathon Project**: 1inch Unite DeFi Hackathon 
- **Challenge**: Extend Fusion+ to Near blockchain ($32,000 bounty)
- **Goal**: Build cross-chain swap between Ethereum and Near
- **Requirements**: 
  - Preserve hashlock/timelock functionality
  - Bidirectional swaps (Ethereum ↔ Near)
  - Onchain execution demo required
- **Stretch Goals**: UI, partial fills, relayer/resolver
- **API Key**: JlJDPEHkMweaDn0I9fXOW1pNGywAJ3Sa

## Project Structure
(To be filled in as we explore the codebase)

## Day 1 Action Plan
1. **Research Phase** (High Priority)
   - Research 1inch Fusion+ architecture and existing cross-chain swap implementation
   - Study Near blockchain smart contract development and deployment  
   - Analyze hashlock/timelock mechanisms in current Fusion+ implementation

2. **Setup Phase** (Medium Priority)
   - Set up development environment for Ethereum and Near
   - Design smart contract architecture for Ethereum-Near bridge
   - Create project structure and initialize repositories

## Research Findings Summary

### 1inch Fusion+ Architecture
- **Cross-chain atomic swaps** using EscrowSrc, EscrowDst, EscrowFactory contracts
- **Hashlock mechanism**: keccak256(secret) with Merkle tree for partial fills
- **Timelock system**: 7-stage progression with private/public phases
- **Safety deposits**: Native token incentives for completion
- **Integration**: Built on Limit Order Protocol with post-interactions

### Near Protocol Development
- **Smart contracts**: Written in Rust, compiled to WebAssembly (WASM)
- **Development tools**: NEAR SDK, NEAR CLI-RS, Foundry-like tooling
- **Cross-chain**: Rainbow Bridge (NEAR ↔ Ethereum) provides reference
- **Testing**: Inline unit tests, testnet deployment capabilities

### Key Technical Requirements for Adaptation
- Preserve hashlock/timelock functionality on non-EVM (Near)
- Implement bidirectional swaps (Ethereum ↔ Near)
- Maintain atomic properties with proper cancellation/rescue mechanisms
- Adapt Solidity patterns to Rust/WASM on Near Protocol

## Development Environment Setup ✅
- **Rust**: v1.88.0 with WASM target support
- **Node.js**: v20.19.0 with npm v11.4.1  
- **Foundry**: forge v1.2.3-stable for Ethereum development
- **NEAR CLI**: near-cli-rs v0.22.0 for Near blockchain interaction
- **Additional Tools**: cargo-near, near-sdk-rs ready for installation

## Additional Resources Added
- **NEAR Examples**: Auction contracts, FT implementations, testing frameworks
- **Solver Architecture**: TEE solver, chain signatures, decentralized solver patterns
- **Development Resources**: cargo-near, wallet selector, near-api-js documentation

## Smart Contract Architecture Design

### Core Components Overview
Based on 1inch Fusion+ analysis and NEAR examples, adapting components for Ethereum ↔ Near:

#### Ethereum Side (Solidity)
1. **EscrowSrc**: Holds user tokens on Ethereum (adapted from 1inch)
2. **EscrowFactory**: Deploys escrow contracts via CREATE2
3. **Integration**: Post-interaction hooks with 1inch Limit Order Protocol

#### Near Side (Rust/WASM)  
1. **EscrowDst**: Holds resolver tokens on Near Protocol
2. **EscrowFactory**: Near equivalent using contract deployment patterns
3. **FT Integration**: Support for NEAR fungible tokens (NEP-141)
4. **Chain Signatures**: Leverage NEAR's chain abstraction for Ethereum interaction

#### Key Adaptations Required
- **Hashlock**: Preserve keccak256(secret) compatibility across chains
- **Timelock**: Adapt 7-stage system to Near's block height timing
- **Partial Fills**: Implement Merkle tree validation in Rust
- **Safety Deposits**: Use native NEAR tokens with proper economics
- **TEE Integration**: Optional trusted execution environment for advanced solver patterns

## Day 1 Completion Status ✅

### Completed Tasks
1. ✅ **Research 1inch Fusion+ architecture** - Comprehensive analysis of atomic swaps, hashlock/timelock mechanisms
2. ✅ **Study Near blockchain development** - Rust/WASM contracts, testing, deployment patterns  
3. ✅ **Analyze hashlock/timelock mechanisms** - 7-stage timelock system, safety deposits, partial fills
4. ✅ **Development environment setup** - Rust 1.88.0, Foundry, NEAR CLI-RS, all tools ready
5. ✅ **Smart contract architecture design** - Detailed technical specifications in ARCHITECTURE.md
6. ✅ **Project structure creation** - Organized Ethereum/Near/Shared directories with initial contracts

### Deliverables Created
