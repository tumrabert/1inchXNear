# Smart Contract Deployment Guide

This guide will help you deploy the necessary smart contracts to make the real atomic swaps work.

## Prerequisites

1. **Ethereum Sepolia Testnet Setup:**
   - MetaMask wallet with Sepolia ETH
   - Get Sepolia ETH from: https://sepoliafaucet.com/
   - Infura or Alchemy API key (optional)

2. **Near Testnet Setup:**
   - Near CLI installed: `npm install -g near-cli-rs`
   - Near testnet account created
   - Some NEAR tokens for deployment

## Step 1: Deploy Ethereum Contracts

### Option A: Using Foundry (Recommended)

1. Navigate to the ethereum directory:
   ```bash
   cd ethereum
   ```

2. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env and add your private key and RPC URL
   ```

3. Deploy the contracts:
   ```bash
   forge script script/DeployEscrow.s.sol --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY --broadcast --verify
   ```

4. Note the deployed EscrowFactory address from the output.

### Option B: Using Remix IDE

1. Open https://remix.ethereum.org/
2. Upload the contracts from `ethereum/src/`:
   - `EscrowSrc.sol`
   - `EscrowFactory.sol`
   - `IEscrowSrc.sol`
   - `IEscrowFactory.sol`
   - `TimelocksLib.sol`
3. Compile with Solidity 0.8.19
4. Deploy EscrowFactory with your address as owner
5. Note the deployed contract address

## Step 2: Deploy Near Contracts

1. Build the contract:
   ```bash
   cd near/contracts
   cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
   ```

2. Deploy to Near testnet:
   ```bash
   near-cli-rs contract deploy fusion-escrow.testnet use-file target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/fusion_near_escrow.wasm without-init-call network-config testnet sign-with-keychain send
   ```

3. Initialize the contract:
   ```bash
   near-cli-rs contract call-function as-transaction fusion-escrow.testnet new json-args {} prepaid-gas '100.000 TeraGas' attached-deposit '0 NEAR' sign-as your-account.testnet network-config testnet sign-with-keychain send
   ```

## Step 3: Update Configuration

After deploying both contracts, update the addresses in the configuration:

1. Edit `demo/lib/realBlockchainService.ts`
2. Update `BLOCKCHAIN_CONFIG`:
   ```typescript
   ethereum: {
     // ... other config
     escrowFactoryAddress: 'YOUR_DEPLOYED_ETHEREUM_ADDRESS'
   },
   near: {
     // ... other config  
     escrowContractId: 'YOUR_DEPLOYED_NEAR_CONTRACT_ID'
   }
   ```

## Step 4: Test the Application

1. Start the demo application:
   ```bash
   cd demo
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Connect both MetaMask (Sepolia) and Near wallets
3. Try executing a real atomic swap!

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Gas estimation failed**: Make sure you have enough ETH for gas fees
2. **Contract not found**: Verify the contract addresses are correct
3. **Transaction reverted**: Check if wallets are connected to correct networks
4. **Near transaction failed**: Ensure Near account has sufficient balance

### Getting Help:

- Check transaction hashes on block explorers:
  - Ethereum: https://sepolia.etherscan.io/
  - Near: https://testnet.nearblocks.io/
- Review console logs for detailed error messages

## Security Notice

‚ö†Ô∏è **Never commit private keys to version control!**

The deployed contracts on testnets are for development and testing only. Do not use mainnet private keys or send mainnet tokens to test contracts.

## Next Steps

Once contracts are deployed and working:

1. Test various swap scenarios (ETH ‚Üí NEAR, NEAR ‚Üí ETH)
2. Verify atomic properties (both sides complete or both fail)
3. Test edge cases (timeouts, cancellations)
4. Optimize gas usage and transaction flow

Happy swapping! üöÄ
