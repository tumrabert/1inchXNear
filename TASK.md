## About This hackathon

When users can move seamlessly between chains; when every trade can access all liquidity; when dApps, wallets and protocols work together by default, and every transaction can take place onchain - that‚Äôs when the real potential of decentralized finance will come alive.

Unite DeFi is your call to make this happen.
Join 1inch and the largest Ethereum developer community to tackle the challenges that will define the next evolution in Web3. Connect networks; bring operations on chain; even create your own dApp. Whatever project you choose, you‚Äôll build alongside the 1inch team, with their cutting-edge tech stack, and finish by presenting your work to some of the most respected minds in the industry‚Äîand all for your share of bounties worth $525,000.

And as for the future? Anything‚Äôs possible. Just ask 1inch: their aggregator was born at an ETHGlobal hackathon.

## About 1inch

1inch provides a suite of powerful tools that enable developers to build smooth DeFi experiences on Ethereum, Ethereum L2s, and beyond. Hackers can utilize our open-source SDKs, smart contract protocols, and robust APIs to build onchain applications. In this hackathon, we are giving builders three distinct challenges:
* Build applications with extensive use of 1inch API
* Extend our Limit Order protocol with creative trading strategies for users
* Expand the reach of 1inch Cross-chain Swap (Fusion+) to one of the following EVM and non-EVM chains: Sui, Aptos, Bitcoin/Bitcoin cash/Doge/Litecoin, Tron, Ton, Monad, Near, Starknet, Cardano, Stellar, XRP Ledger, ICP, Tezos, Polkadot, EOS, or Cosmos.


## What we are going to do

### üåê Extend Fusion+ to Near ‚∏∫ $32,000     

Build a novel extension for 1inch Cross-chain Swap (Fusion+) that enables swaps between Ethereum and Near.

Qualification Requirements
Requirements:
- Preserve hashlock and timelock functionality for the non-EVM implementation
- Swap functionality should be bidirectional (swaps should be possible to and from Ethereum)
- Onchain (mainnet or testnet) execution of token transfers should be presented during the final demo
Stretch goals (not hard requirements):
- UI
- Enable partial fills
- Relayer and resolver
